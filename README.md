Average Number of Indian Textiles Sold in London, 1631–1672 (in Units)  
Source: To determine the type of textiles the glossaries in the appendices of Irwin, 1966 (“A Glossary of Textile Terms”) and Chaudhuri, 1978 (“The Grouped List and the Glossary of Indian Textile Types”, see 500 ff.) were used.

Indian Textiles Sold in London, 1631–1672

Total Textiles Imported from India, 1664–1750 (Annual Averages in Units)  
Source: The values were calculated on the basis of figures kindly provided by Prof. K.N. Chaudhuri who published parts of this material in his book “Trading World of Asia” (1978, Appendix 5, Statistical Tables; Table C.24).  

**[Figure 25](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/figure_25.tsv)**  
Textile Imports from India and Printed Cloth in England. The two data series were indexed, 1713 = 100.  
Source: Ashton, 1959, 142 ff.; Ashton, 1961, 248; See [Figure 24](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/figure_24.tsv).   

**[Raw Sales Data](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/raw_sales_data.tsv)**  
Indian Textiles Sold in London and Share of the Individual Textile Types.  
Source: 1631–1664: IO: Home Misc. Series, Vol. 6, fols. 3–354; 1665–1666: ibid., Vol. 7, 127ff.; 1669–1672: ibid., Vol. 8, 275ff.

**[Raw Import Data](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/raw_import_data.tsv)**  
Indian Textiles imported to England and Share of the Individual Textile Types.  
Source: The values were calculated on the basis of figures kindly provided by Prof. K.N. Chaudhuri who published parts of this material in his book “Trading World of Asia” (1978, Appendix 5, Statistical Tables; Table C.24). However, only textile imports in their entirety were listed in his book. Chaudhuri’s extensive data collection also contains unpublished information on the individual types of textiles and the proportions in which they were imported into England. The material is arranged according to textiles from Bombay, Madras and Bengal and also contains lists of the individual types of textiles and the corresponding numbers of pieces shipped to England between 1660 and 1760 for each of these places of origin. For my purposes, I have prepared annual lists and calculated the percentages in which the various cloths were imported into England (see [Raw Import Data](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/raw_import_data.tsv)). The data in [Figure 24](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/figure_24.tsv) were calculated in the similar way. The sources used by Chaudhuri are from the India Office Records: The Account-General’s Department: General Ledgers Books and Commerce Journals; Proceedings: General Ledgers and Journals from Bombay, Madras and Bengal (see Chaudhuri, 1978, 506). The data for Figures [22](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/figure_22.tsv) and [24](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/figure_24.tsv) are not from the same sources, and the series of figures are not directly comparable. [Figure 22](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/figure_22.tsv) shows the sales of Indian textiles in London auctions; [Figure 24](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/figure_24.tsv) shows the gross imports of Indian textiles, based on cargo data from the East India Company ships. However, the high correspondence between the percentages of white cloth for the period in which the two charts overlap (1664–1670: 62.3% for the [Figure 22](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/figure_22.tsv) series, 60.9% for [Figure 24](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/figure_24.tsv)) provides an indication that the proportion between coloured and white fabrics in the holds of the ships was roughly the same as in the London sales halls.

**[Textile Glossary](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/textile_glossary.tsv)**  
Description of textiles listed in [Raw Sales Data](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/raw_sales_data.tsv) and [Raw Import Data](https://github.com/fabianaiolfi/calicoes/blob/main/data/raw_import_data.tsv).  
The textiles designated as “white cotton cloth” — in contrast to the other fabrics — were eligible for further processing in the English dyeing or Calico printing works.
